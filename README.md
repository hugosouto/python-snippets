# Python Snippets Repository

This is my personal repository of Python snippets. Here, I share useful pieces of code that I have used or developed during my Python learning journey.

## What are Snippets?

Snippets are small, reusable pieces of code that can be incorporated into larger programs. They are useful for solving common programming problems.

## How to Use This Repository

Each type of snippets is contained in its own Python (.py) file and is accompanied by comments explaining what the snippet does and how to use it. To use a snippet, you can simply copy the code and paste it into your own program.

## Available Snippets

Here are some of the snippets you will find in this repository:

1. [Decorators](Decorators.py): A snippet of basic uses of function decorators.
2. ...

## Contributing

Even though this is a personal repository, I am open to contributions. If you have a snippet you think would be useful, feel free to open a pull request.
